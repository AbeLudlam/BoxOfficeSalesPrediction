This is for the Box Office sales prediction program that uses Twitter datasets as input files. This goes over every dependency of the program and every file in this folder. The program was made for Linux Ubuntu 16.04 system and in Python 3.

Python 3 and its associated libraries will be required to run this program.

Python 3 Dependencies: 


'pip3 install tkinter' or 'sudo apt-get install tkinter'
'pip3 install pandas'
'pip3 install re'
'pip3 install glob'
'pip3 install unicodedata'
'pip3 install textblob'
'pip3 install pymysql'
'pip3 install mysql'
'pip3 install sqlalchemy'
'pip3 install mysql-connector'
'pip3 install sklearn' and/or 'pip3 install -U scikit-learn'
'pip3 install numpy'

Make sure these are up to date.

For jupyter notebook:
'pip3 install jupyter'

If you have an sql installation run the 'createSQL.sql' script, if not, read the 'MariaDBsqlsetup.txt file'

__________________________________________________________________________________________________

Folders: 

Backup Default Dataset: A folder that contains a backup for the default dataset, just in case the main one gets infected.

BoxSentiment: A folder containing completed box office sentiment application on 5 movies not part of the main database set. You can use these for individual Box office predictions, or to find out the budget and box office by looking at them with the see result function of the program.
Contains Box.csv files.

DatabaseTweets: A folder containing all tweet sets of the movies in the database. These can be used to apply sentiment to. Their budgets and box office are in the Default Dataset, and can be used with the see result function of the program.

NonDatabaseTweets: A folder containing the datasets of the 5 movies not part of the database. Can also be used to apply sentiment to. Their budgets and box officce are in the files in BoxSentiment folder.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________

Files:

Comments.py: The file containing the comments for every function and global vairable of the program "PredictionProgram.py". Was done to be easy and fast to read.

createSQL.sql: The sql script needed to create the database on a sql server. The file MariaDBsqlsetup.txt goes over all the necessary steps to set up a mariaDB sql server.

Dataset_Predict_comments.py: The file that contains the comments going over the main prediction algorithm that was used in the program. Is is the core function that predicts the box office sales for the database or dataset.

DefaultDataset.csv: A dataset containing the values found in the database. This will be used on startup of the program to rewrite the temporary database in the "Update Database" page of the program. Can also be tested at anytime in the program.

MariaDBsqlsetup.txt: A file that goes over the steps to setup a mariaDB sql server to use for the main program.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________
PredictionProgram.py: The main prediction program that is meant to be run in Jupyter Notebook and utilizes the database. To access:

Create the database as specified in MariaDBsqlsetup.txt and using the createSQL.sql script. Make sure the SQL server is up, as the program needs it.

In the terminal type: "jupyter notebook" (if you have jupyter installed)

Once in jupyter notebook you can use the "SalesPredictionJupyter.ipynb" to be able to run the program.
If that doesn't work, create a new notebook and enter the following commands on two lines and then run.
%gui tk
%run -i 'PredictionProgram.py'

If it is the first time you starting this program up, go to "Update Database" and choose to rewrite the database with "DefaultDataset.csv". Then restart the program.

The program should work normally from here on out.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________

ProgramNoDatabase.py: A version of the program that does not use a database or jupyter notebook. This is run from the terminal with "python3 ProgramNoDatabase.py". This is a backup, just in case. Make sure to not try to update the database, as it does not exist. If you wish to update the default dataset, just combine Box.csv, or BoxSentiment.csv files to the DefaultDataset.csv and then change the name of the outputted file to DefaultDataset.csv.

requirements.txt: A list of the versions of the main dependencies, generated by "pipreq". In case one of the dependencies don't match'.

SalesPredictionJupyter.ipnyb: A file that contains the settings used to run the program in Jupyter notebook. The commands are displayed above as part of PredictionProgram.py
